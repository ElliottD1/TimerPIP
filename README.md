
Easy To Use Timer!

This is my first Python Package and I made this just to practice not to truly use as a package. Hope you enjoy!



timer.timer(minutes,seconds)= Counts down the amount of time put in to the parameters before ending.

Print Timer: timer.ptimer(minutes,seconds)= prints seconds inputted into parameters. Same as Timer but prints seconds.

StopWatch: timer.swatch()= Returns the amount of time taken before finishing an action.
