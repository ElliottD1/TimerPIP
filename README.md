## Installation

Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/GiraffeTimer/) to install:

```





- timer.timer(minutes,seconds)= Counts down the amount of time put in to the parameters before ending.

- Print Timer: timer.ptimer(minutes,seconds)= prints seconds inputted into parameters. Same as Timer but prints seconds.

- StopWatch: timer.swatch()= Returns the amount of time taken before finishing an action.

timer.timer(1,20)
#Counts down for 1 minutes and 20 seconds

timer.swatch()
#waits for user action
```

This is my first Python Package and I made this just to practice not to truly use as a package. Hope you enjoy!
