Easy To Use Timer!

This is my first Python Package and I made this just to practice not to truly use as a package.
Hope you enjoy!



import Method: from Timers import timer
Timer: timer(minutes,seconds)= Counts down the amount of time put in to the parameters before ending.


import Method: from Timers import ptimer
Print Timer: ptimer(minutes,seconds)= prints seconds inputted into parameters. Same as Timer but prints seconds.


import Method: from Timers import swatch
StopWatch: swatch()= Returns the amount of time taken before finishing an action.
